OmniCode v1.3 update can be downloaded [here](/OmniCode).

A full-featured **Sciter specific CSS editor** is the great new addition of this update. Soon I will make a Google slide presentation about it. In the meantime, check the [Changelog](/OmniCode/Changelog) for all current features it supports.
