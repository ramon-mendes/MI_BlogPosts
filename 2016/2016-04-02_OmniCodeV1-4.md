v1.4 update can be downloaded [here](/OmniCode).

The now improved extension provides **full Intellisense support** for user defined symbols in TIScript editor. You can browse your own classes, namespaces, functions, and variables, in addition to the already supported browsing of the built-in APIs.

[OmniCode presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/132GgHy3w7S_cP_YRIV5RJFioMSSOVNpEN1l_Zq5BFCU/edit#slide=id.gde4483abd_1_0) is updated with a glimpse of all features of this extension. Check the [changelog](/OmniCode/Changelog) for all new stuff I added in v1.4.

This is a major milestone of this product, so I am pleased to give it a limited-time price offer: **$59** for an Indie license.

If you wanna test out the new features and have already expired your 30 days trial period, just send me an [e-mail](mailto:ramon@misoftware.rs) and I will send you another **15 days license**.
