**OmniCode v1.6** — [Download](/OmniCode), [Changelog](/OmniCode/Changelog)

OmniCode is now adding Intellisense support based on your HTML code. It means that TIScript Intellisense now knows about your HTML DOM tree so, given a CSS selector in TIScript, you can find where lies the corresponding HTML piece (with F12/Go to Definition). I am just begging this support, so expect many features to be added.

Also, now the CSS editor features the standard colorpicker from VS:

**OmniView v1.3** — [more info](/Home/Post/OmniView)

OmniView now supports VS2013. I did it because sometimes a bloated VS2015 instalattion, full of extensions, can be really slow, so I normally switch to VS2013 which is more lightweight.
