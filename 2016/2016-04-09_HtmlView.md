HtmlView is a free VS 2015 extension for Web developers.

It provides the HTML editor an area where it shows a preview of your HTML page. Essentially it is a Chromium engine inside Visual Studio showing your HTML page. Behind the scenes, I am using the excelent **CefSharp** library to instantiate a Chromium browser.

### Features

- Chrome DevTools (shortcut: F12)
- Console area shows any log output (errors or console.log() calls)
- CTRL+SHIFT+CLICK any element to inspect it

### How to use

- first install it by [downloading at VS Gallery](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=RamonFMendes.HtmlView)
- previewer by default is always OFF for all .HTML files
- you must enable it in a per-file basis; to do it add the following line at the start of your HTML and save the file:

```HTML
<!-- HtmlView:on -->
```

- it is always ON for files named 'unittest.html'
- you can toggle the previewer by simply setting it to off (or just remove the first line) and save the file:

```HTML
<!-- HtmlView:off -->
```

- you can make the console area always visible:

```HTML
<!-- HtmlView:on, console:off -->
```

### For Sciter developers

The cool thing is that you can use this extension aside with [OmniView](/Home/Post/OmniView), and you can simultaneously preview your HTML in Sciter engine and in a Chrome-based browser. I really don't know the usefulness of this, but anyway:
