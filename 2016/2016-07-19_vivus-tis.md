**vivus.tis** brings SVG animations to Sciter!

It allows you to animate SVG <path> elements, giving them the appearence of being drawn. The implementation essentially uses `stroke-dasharray` + `stroke-dashoffset` to animate the path's stroke.

This is actually a port of [vivus.js](https://maxwellito.github.io/vivus/) library to TIScript. In fact it is 100% API compatible, so you can grab any sample for vivus.js and get it working in Sciter.
