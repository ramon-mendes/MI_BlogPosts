**Wednesday CODE** will be a biweekly showcase of any Sciter HTML sample I end building up!
It is not weekly because so I don't commit too much, but it might appear in a weekly basis, hopefully.

All HTML samples will be hosted at GitHub here: [https://github.com/ramon-mendes/WednesdayCODE](https://github.com/ramon-mendes/WednesdayCODE)

It will be room for Sciter insights and technical explanations. I will probably add comments support to the site for you to easily make enquiries.

**How to quickly view the HTML samples?** Using [OmniFiddler](http://misoftware.rs/Home/Post/OmniFiddler):

<a href="http://misoftware.rs/cdn/Apps/OmniFiddler/OmniFiddler-BleedingEdge.zip" class="btn btn-success">Download OmniFiddler</a>
- download it and extract somewhere
- run it, of course
- simply **drag-n-drop** any 'omnifiddler://' URL inside it to view the interactive Sciter page
- in Omnifiddler, press the 'Run' button to actually execute the sample

URL of samples will look like this:

<a href="omnifiddler://url/https://rawcdn.githack.com/ramon-mendes/WednesdayCODE/master/TransitionsJoy/TransitionsJoy.html" class="fiddler-link">Drag-me to OmniFiddler</a>

This way you can easily identify them and can simply drag it to inside OmniFiddler.

OmniFiddler let's you easily make changes to the HTML code and immediatly see the output.
