Just wanna highlight some new samples found in last SDK showing some great Sciter's capabilities:

#### **/samples/css3-variables/script-interaction-effects.htm**

Here the gradient is drawn using basic CSS `background: radial-gradient` property. But in Sciter you can modify CSS properties at runtime through TIScript. In this case it's using CSS variables + TIScript.

Here is the entire code:

#### **/samples/effects.css++/magnifying-on-hover.htm**

This is an implementation of OSX animated dock. It's essentially done in 17 lines of CSS code, using `flow:horizontal;` to properly lay the boxes and `transition: size(quad-out,300ms)` to animate/grow them on mouse hover.

Here is the entire code:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/midiway/6922d685c0eb65013eb51c5b9a294a06.js"></script>

You can see Sciter samples using [The Library](/Home/Post/TheLibrary), as I am doing. I am recording the animated GIFs using ScreenToGif.

Thanks Andrew for providing them.
