**'The Library'** is a new free desktop app for Sciter developers. It is a collection of helpful content (like Sciter's SDK documentation), tooling, and HTML samples,
making then easily accessible for your day-to-day Sciter related work.

It has the following tabs:

- **Docs and Docs pages**: documentation found in the Sciter's official SDK
- **Docs extra**: more documentation and utilities written by MI Software
- **LibConsole**: API documentation for LibConsole TIScript library (MI Software made)
- **SDK Samples**: offers an easy way to browse and search Sciter's SDK samples
- **Playground**: let's you browser a collection of open-source Sciter samples crafted by MI Software
- **Fiddler**: a simple HTML editor to quickly test pages
