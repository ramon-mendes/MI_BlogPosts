OmniLite is a new free and open-source software with complete HTML inspector for Sciter development.

What does is differs from Omni? It only misses the TIScript debugger, everything else is there.

But it also differs for good, since now it runs on Windows and OSX.

So yeah, Sciter community in gaining an incredible piece of sotfware, and I hope that, as it is now open-source, with your help, it can become even more incredible.
