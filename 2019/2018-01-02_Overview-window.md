OmniCode now offers a dockable window with a listing of all TIScript declarations of the current file:

It also has a search input to filter out the list.

Clicking an item moves the cursor to where it is declared in code.

Shortcut to opening it is `CTRL + E + O` or just go to `View -> Other windows -> TIScript overview`.
