OmniCode v1.1 update can be downloaded from VS Gallery: [VS2013](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/c5f392c9-d611-4b95-b50d-a3292c131deb) or [VS2015](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/40fd8fa8-dd1d-4a34-971b-aed061ec3332)

This update brings a Semantic Analysis engine which parses TIScript code in realtime
and builds-up a database of user defined symbols.

Also, I added QuickInfo tooltips which shows up when you hover over identifiers defined in your code
and also for the built-in TIScript API calls.

## Semantic Analysis

Semantic Analysis allows implementation of Go To Definition (F12) feature in Visual Studio.

This first implementation only considers variable and function symbols. So every function and every variable you define in your code is tracked,
and so, when your code is accessing one of them, you can simply press F12 to localize in what file and line of code it is beeing defined.

F12 also works for ```include "XYZ";``` statements. In this case it will search and open the included file in a new editor window.

There is a lot of home for improving when you have a Semantic Analysis engine. Here is a road-map of things on the horizon:

- auto-completion based on semantic analysis information
- code refactoring: rename variable (will rename all references to it)
- keep track of user-defined classes, properties, decorators, constructors and namespaces
