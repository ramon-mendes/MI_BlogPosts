![C# Sciter bindings](/Content/BlogCDN/csharp-bindings.png)

Today we are releasing SciterSharp, a .Net library with C# bindings for Sciter engine. It's a open-source project and is available at [GitHub](https://github.com/ramon-mendes/SciterSharp). You should install it via the [official NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SciterSharp/).

## Bootstrap your C# Sciter desktop app

For easily starting your .NET desktop app for Sciter check our [Sciter Bootstrap](/Bootstrap) on-line tool. It now features a C# package with SciterSharp already included as a NuGet reference. Also, there is a corresponding C# Webcam template which uses AForge.net to capture your webcam image frames.

## Documentation

I still have to create a bit of documentation with general instructions. For the minimal code for setuping a Sciter window/page you really want to download a C# package from Sciter Bootstrap and peek in the source-code.

Check the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/ramon-mendes/SciterSharp) for more information about what is supported from Sciter API.
