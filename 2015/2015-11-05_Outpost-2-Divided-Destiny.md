So it was back in the nineties when I bought one of those magazines with a game CD, a completely random pick, and it was the game called [Outpost 2: Divided Destiny](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outpost_2:_Divided_Destiny). It turned to be the first game focused in the narrative I've played, and it was so cool to be immersed in the story-line, that I still remember the history.

I've managed to find the old CD, and peeking inside, I found a little gem: included in the CD is a novella text by the author J. Steven York who also wrote the game's story-line. And the text is actually a pretty good Science fiction one. So I am sharing here this little treasure which was lost in the ages.
